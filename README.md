### Project Description
The brief described an anonymous journal post that allowed for emoji reactions, gifs and comments.
We took inspiration from www.fmylife.com. To differentiate ours to avoid copyright legal action from FML, we decided to gear towards 'randomness' of stories. In short, something unusual that happened to you in a small way that you were unable to share with your friends for whatever reason, and search for validation on the internet.
